-Reads C Program
  -while(getline)
     //process

-variable names into array
-Array of array of pointers for var names which match, maybe?

As in:

["meme", "gog", "aaaaaa", "vov", "aaaaaa"]

//It is assumed that the first n letters are all the same in this group
[0 ---> [&"aaaaaa", &"aaaaaa"]

//If we take this approach, need to ensure that the memes are unmatched, i.e., while iterating over array of varnames, be certain
