Testing could probably be accomplished by throwing a combination
of words with blanks, tabs, and newlines, and keeping track of what
the expected output should look like. These are most likely to
uncover bugs, as this is the kind of input that we are directly
checking for inside our program (and thus logic errors will
reveal themselves the most, etc. etc.)
